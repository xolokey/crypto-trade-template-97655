# WebSocket Service Unit Tests - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive unit tests for the WebSocketService as specified in task 6.5 of the WebSocket Real-Time Data specification.

## Test Results

✅ **All 33 tests passing**

```
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests       33 passed (33)
Duration    ~2s
```

## Test Coverage

### 1. Connection Lifecycle (6 tests)
- ✅ Initializes with CLOSED state
- ✅ Transitions to CONNECTING state when connect() is called
- ✅ Transitions to OPEN state when connection opens
- ✅ Transitions to CLOSING then CLOSED when disconnect() is called
- ✅ Prevents duplicate connections when already connected
- ✅ Handles connection close events and attempts reconnection

### 2. Reconnection Logic with Exponential Backoff (6 tests)
- ✅ Attempts to reconnect after unexpected connection loss
- ✅ Uses exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s max)
- ✅ Caps reconnection delay at 30 seconds
- ✅ Stops reconnecting after max attempts
- ✅ Resets reconnection attempts on successful connection
- ✅ Does not reconnect if disconnect was intentional

### 3. Subscription Persistence (7 tests)
- ✅ Tracks subscribed symbols in memory
- ✅ Sends subscribe messages when connected
- ✅ Does not send subscribe messages when disconnected
- ✅ Automatically resubscribes to all symbols after reconnection
- ✅ Removes symbols on unsubscribe
- ✅ Sends unsubscribe messages when connected
- ✅ Persists subscriptions across multiple reconnections

### 4. Message Batching (6 tests)
- ✅ Batches messages within 100ms window
- ✅ Processes messages in order
- ✅ Limits queue size to prevent memory issues
- ✅ Handles multiple batches correctly
- ✅ Tracks message count in metrics
- ✅ Calculates latency from message timestamps

### 5. Error Handling (3 tests)
- ✅ Tracks error count in metrics
- ✅ Calls registered error handlers on error
- ✅ Handles malformed JSON messages gracefully

### 6. Metrics and Monitoring (3 tests)
- ✅ Tracks connection time
- ✅ Tracks last message time
- ✅ Tracks active subscriptions count

### 7. Handler Management (2 tests)
- ✅ Allows adding and removing message handlers
- ✅ Allows adding and removing connection state change handlers

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation satisfies all requirements from task 6.5:

- ✅ **Requirement 1.4**: Test connection lifecycle
- ✅ **Requirement 1.5**: Test reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Requirement 2.5**: Test subscription persistence
- ✅ **Additional**: Test message batching

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **src/test/setup.ts** - Test setup and global mocks
2. **src/services/__tests__/websocketService.test.ts** - Comprehensive test suite (33 tests)
3. **src/services/__tests__/README.md** - Test documentation

### Modified Files
1. **vite.config.ts** - Added Vitest configuration
2. **package.json** - Added test scripts

## Test Infrastructure

### Testing Framework
- **Vitest** - Fast unit test framework for Vite projects
- **@testing-library/react** - React testing utilities
- **happy-dom** - Lightweight DOM implementation for tests

### Test Scripts Added
```json
{
  "test": "vitest --run",
  "test:watch": "vitest",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage"
}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/services/__tests__/websocketService.test.ts
```

## Key Testing Patterns Used

### 1. WebSocket Mocking
```typescript
mockWebSocket = {
  readyState: WebSocket.CONNECTING,
  send: vi.fn(),
  close: vi.fn(),
  onopen: null,
  onclose: null,
  onmessage: null,
  onerror: null,
};

global.WebSocket = vi.fn(() => mockWebSocket) as any;
```

### 2. Fake Timers for Time-Dependent Tests
```typescript
vi.useFakeTimers();
// ... test code ...
vi.advanceTimersByTime(1000);
vi.useRealTimers();
```

### 3. Event Simulation
```typescript
// Simulate connection open
mockWebSocket.readyState = WebSocket.OPEN;
if (mockWebSocket.onopen) {
  mockWebSocket.onopen(new Event('open'));
}

// Simulate message received
if (mockWebSocket.onmessage) {
  mockWebSocket.onmessage(new MessageEvent('message', { 
    data: JSON.stringify({ type: 'price_update' }) 
  }));
}
```

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all public methods
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and isolated
- **Clarity**: Clear test names describing what is being tested
- **Maintainability**: Well-organized with descriptive comments
- **Performance**: Fast execution (~2 seconds for 33 tests)

## Next Steps

The WebSocketService now has a solid test foundation. Future enhancements could include:

1. Integration tests with actual WebSocket server
2. Performance benchmarking tests
3. Memory leak detection tests
4. Network condition simulation tests
5. Load testing for high-frequency messages

## Conclusion

Task 6.5 is complete with a comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Connection lifecycle management
- Exponential backoff reconnection logic
- Subscription persistence across reconnections
- Message batching for performance
- Error handling and recovery
- Metrics tracking
- Handler management

All tests are passing and the WebSocketService is production-ready with confidence in its reliability and correctness.
