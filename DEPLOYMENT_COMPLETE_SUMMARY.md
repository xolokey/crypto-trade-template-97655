## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Frontend (Vercel)
    ↓ HTTPS
Backend API (Railway)
    ↓ Redis Pub/Sub
Redis (Upstash)
    ↓ Redis Pub/Sub
WebSocket Server (Railway)
    ↓ WSS
Frontend (Vercel)

External Services:
- Supabase (Database & Auth)
- Gemini AI (Analysis)
- Market Data APIs (NSE, AlphaVantage, TwelveData)
```

## 🎯 What This Solves

### ✅ Problems Fixed

1. **No Real-Time Updates** → WebSocket server provides live data
2. **No Backend Integration** → .NET API deployed and connected
3. **Simulated Data Only** → Real market data from APIs
4. **Local-Only Development** → Full production deployment

### ✅ Features Enabled

- ✅ Real-time stock price updates
- ✅ Live market indices
- ✅ WebSocket connections
- ✅ Redis pub/sub messaging
- ✅ Backend API integration
- ✅ Production-grade performance
- ✅ Scalable architecture
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Free Tier (Current)
- **Vercel:** $0/month (100GB bandwidth, 6000 build minutes)
- **Railway:** $0/month ($5 credit covers ~$5 usage)
- **Upstash:** $0/month (10K commands/day, 256MB)
- **Total:** $0/month

### At Scale
- **Vercel:** $20/month (Pro plan)
- **Railway:** $10-20/month (2 services)
- **Upstash:** $5-10/month (higher usage)
- **Total:** $35-50/month

## 🚀 Deployment Timeline

| Step | Service | Time | Difficulty |
|------|---------|------|------------|
| 1 | Redis (Upstash) | 10 min | Easy |
| 2 | Backend API (Railway) | 20 min | Medium |
| 3 | WebSocket (Railway) | 15 min | Medium |
| 4 | Frontend (Vercel) | 15 min | Easy |
| 5 | CORS Config | 10 min | Easy |
| 6 | Testing | 15 min | Easy |
| **Total** | **All Services** | **~1-2 hours** | **Medium** |
