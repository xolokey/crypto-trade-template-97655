# WebSocket Load Testing Guide

This guide explains how to perform load testing on the WebSocket server to verify performance requirements.

## Overview

The load testing script simulates 100 concurrent WebSocket connections and measures:
- Message delivery latency
- Delivery success rate (target: > 99%)
- Memory usage over time
- Connection stability

## Prerequisites

1. **WebSocket Server Running**: Ensure the WebSocket server is running
   ```bash
   cd backend-ws
   node server.js
   ```

2. **.NET Backend Running**: The backend should be running to provide real data
   ```bash
   cd backend/StockTracker.API
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Redis Running**: Redis must be running for PubSub
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

## Running the Load Test

### Basic Test (Default Configuration)

```bash
cd backend-ws
node load-test.js
```

This will:
- Connect 100 concurrent clients
- Subscribe each client to 5 symbols (RELIANCE, TCS, INFY, HDFCBANK, ICICIBANK)
- Run for 60 seconds
- Collect and report metrics

### Custom Configuration

You can customize the test using environment variables:

```bash
# Test with different WebSocket URL
WS_URL=ws://localhost:8081 node load-test.js

# Test with more clients
NUM_CLIENTS=200 node load-test.js

# Test for longer duration (5 minutes)
TEST_DURATION_MS=300000 node load-test.js
```

### Available Configuration Options

Edit the `CONFIG` object in `load-test.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  WS_URL: 'ws://localhost:8081',        // WebSocket server URL
  NUM_CLIENTS: 100,                      // Number of concurrent clients
  TEST_DURATION_MS: 60000,               // Test duration (1 minute)
  SYMBOLS: ['RELIANCE', 'TCS', ...],     // Symbols to subscribe to
  MEMORY_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS: 5000,        // Memory snapshot interval
  REPORT_INTERVAL_MS: 10000,             // Interim report interval
};
```

## Understanding the Results

### Connection Metrics

```
üìä CONNECTION METRICS
Total Connection Attempts: 100
Successful Connections: 100
Failed Connections: 0
Connection Success Rate: 100.00%
Disconnections During Test: 0
```

**What to look for:**
- Connection success rate should be 100%
- No disconnections during the test
- Connection times should be < 1000ms

### Message Metrics

```
üì® MESSAGE METRICS
Total Messages Sent: 500
Total Messages Received: 12,450
Message Delivery Rate: 99.60%
```

**What to look for:**
- **Delivery rate > 99%** ‚úÖ (This is the key requirement)
- Messages received should be proportional to test duration
- No significant message loss

### Latency Metrics

```
‚è±Ô∏è  LATENCY METRICS (ms)
Samples: 12,450
Min: 45.23
Max: 892.15
Average: 234.56
Median: 198.34
P95: 456.78
P99: 678.90

Latency Target (P95 < 500ms): ‚úÖ PASS
```

**What to look for:**
- **P95 latency < 500ms** ‚úÖ (This is the key requirement)
- Average latency should be < 300ms
- P99 latency should be < 1000ms
- No extreme outliers (max should be reasonable)

### Memory Metrics

```
üíæ MEMORY METRICS
Initial Heap Used: 45.23 MB
Final Heap Used: 52.34 MB
Heap Growth: 7.11 MB
Initial RSS: 78.45 MB
Final RSS: 85.67 MB
RSS Growth: 7.22 MB
Heap Growth Rate: 15.72%
```

**What to look for:**
- Heap growth should be < 50% (indicates no major memory leaks)
- RSS growth should be proportional to number of connections
- Memory should stabilize after initial connection phase

### Error Metrics

```
‚ùå ERROR METRICS
Total Errors: 5
Error Rate: 0.04%
```

**What to look for:**
- Error rate should be < 1%
- No critical errors (connection failures, parse errors)
- Occasional timeout errors are acceptable

### Test Results Summary

```
‚úÖ TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
Connection Success Rate: 100.00%
Message Delivery Rate: 99.60% ‚úÖ (Target: > 99%)
P95 Latency: 456.78ms ‚úÖ (Target: < 500ms)
Memory Growth: 15.72%

‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Message delivery rate > 99%
- ‚úÖ P95 latency < 500ms
- ‚úÖ No connection failures
- ‚úÖ Memory growth < 50%

## Interpreting Test Failures

### Low Delivery Rate (< 99%)

**Possible causes:**
- WebSocket server overloaded
- Network issues
- Backend not publishing updates fast enough
- Redis PubSub issues

**Solutions:**
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify Redis is running and healthy
- Ensure backend is fetching data for subscribed symbols
- Consider scaling WebSocket server

### High Latency (P95 > 500ms)

**Possible causes:**
- Slow backend API responses
- Redis PubSub delays
- Network latency
- Server CPU/memory constraints

**Solutions:**
- Optimize backend data fetching
- Check Redis performance
- Profile WebSocket server for bottlenecks
- Consider caching strategies

### Connection Failures

**Possible causes:**
- Server not running
- Port conflicts
- Firewall blocking connections
- Server connection limit reached

**Solutions:**
- Verify server is running: `ps aux | grep node`
- Check port availability: `lsof -i :8081`
- Increase server connection limits
- Check server logs for errors

### Memory Growth

**Possible causes:**
- Memory leaks in message handling
- Unbounded message queues
- Connection objects not being cleaned up
- Event listener leaks

**Solutions:**
- Review code for memory leaks
- Implement proper cleanup in disconnect handlers
- Use WeakMap/WeakSet where appropriate
- Profile with Node.js memory profiler

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Stress Test (200 Clients)

```bash
NUM_CLIENTS=200 TEST_DURATION_MS=120000 node load-test.js
```

### Endurance Test (1 Hour)

```bash
TEST_DURATION_MS=3600000 node load-test.js
```

### Network Simulation

Use tools like `tc` (traffic control) to simulate network conditions:

```bash
# Add 100ms latency
sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 100ms

# Remove latency
sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root
```

### Production-like Test

```bash
WS_URL=wss://your-production-url.com node load-test.js
```

## Continuous Integration

Add load testing to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/load-test.yml
name: Load Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  load-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    services:
      redis:
        image: redis:7-alpine
        ports:
          - 6379:6379
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd backend-ws
          npm install
      
      - name: Start WebSocket server
        run: |
          cd backend-ws
          node server.js &
          sleep 5
      
      - name: Run load test
        run: |
          cd backend-ws
          node load-test.js
```

## Monitoring During Tests

### Server Metrics

Monitor the WebSocket server during tests:

```bash
# CPU and memory usage
top -p $(pgrep -f "node server.js")

# Network connections
watch -n 1 'netstat -an | grep :8081 | wc -l'

# Redis monitoring
redis-cli monitor
```

### Client Metrics

The load test script provides real-time metrics:
- Interim reports every 10 seconds
- Memory snapshots every 5 seconds
- Connection status updates
- Error logging

## Troubleshooting

### Test Hangs or Doesn't Complete

- Check if WebSocket server is responding: `curl http://localhost:8081/health`
- Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Check for port conflicts: `lsof -i :8081`
- Review server logs for errors

### Inconsistent Results

- Run multiple test iterations
- Ensure no other processes are competing for resources
- Use dedicated test environment
- Check for network instability

### Test Fails in CI but Passes Locally

- Verify CI environment has sufficient resources
- Check for timing issues (increase timeouts)
- Ensure all services are properly started
- Review CI logs for specific errors

## Best Practices

1. **Baseline Testing**: Run tests on a clean system to establish baseline metrics
2. **Regular Testing**: Run load tests before each release
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track metrics over time to detect performance regressions
4. **Realistic Scenarios**: Test with production-like data and traffic patterns
5. **Gradual Load**: Start with fewer clients and gradually increase
6. **Monitor Resources**: Watch CPU, memory, and network during tests
7. **Document Results**: Keep records of test results for comparison

## Requirements Verification

This load test verifies the following requirements:

- **Requirement 5.1**: System maintains sub-second update latency with 100 concurrent users
- **Requirement 5.2**: Message batching reduces overhead
- **Requirement 2.1**: Price updates received within 500ms (P95 latency)

## Next Steps

After successful load testing:

1. ‚úÖ Document baseline performance metrics
2. ‚úÖ Set up monitoring alerts for production
3. ‚úÖ Create performance regression tests
4. ‚úÖ Plan for horizontal scaling if needed
5. ‚úÖ Optimize based on test results
