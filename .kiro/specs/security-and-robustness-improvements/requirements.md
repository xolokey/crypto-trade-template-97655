# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the security, robustness, and logical correctness of the Stock Tracker application. Based on a comprehensive code review, several critical security vulnerabilities, error handling gaps, and performance issues have been identified across the frontend, backend, and WebSocket server. This feature aims to systematically address these issues to make the application production-ready.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend API to be secure against common vulnerabilities, so that user data and financial information are protected from malicious attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database query is executed THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries or Entity Framework's built-in protections to prevent SQL injection attacks
2. WHEN the CORS policy is configured THEN the system SHALL restrict allowed origins to specific frontend domains instead of allowing any origin
3. WHEN an API endpoint receives user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input data before processing
4. IF the application is deployed to production THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all API communications
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization checks on all protected endpoints

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling throughout the application, so that I can quickly diagnose issues and users receive meaningful feedback when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails in the backend THEN the system SHALL return specific error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500, etc.)
2. WHEN an exception occurs in a controller THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and context
3. WHEN the frontend receives an error response THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages that explain what went wrong
4. WHEN a network request fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
5. WHEN an error occurs in a React component THEN the ErrorBoundary SHALL catch it and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the application

### Requirement 3: Frontend Input Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to validate my input before submission, so that I receive immediate feedback and avoid submitting invalid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters data in CreateAlertDialog THEN the system SHALL validate that price thresholds are positive numbers before allowing submission
2. WHEN a user enters data in AddToPortfolioDialog THEN the system SHALL validate that quantity and purchase price are valid positive numbers
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display inline error messages next to the invalid fields
4. WHEN a form is submitted with invalid data THEN the system SHALL prevent the submission and highlight all validation errors
5. WHEN a user corrects invalid input THEN the system SHALL clear the error message for that field in real-time

### Requirement 4: WebSocket Security

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the WebSocket server to use secure connections and validate client origins, so that real-time data transmission is protected from interception and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket server is started THEN the system SHALL use WSS (WebSocket Secure) protocol instead of WS
2. WHEN a client attempts to connect to the WebSocket server THEN the system SHALL validate the origin header against an allowlist of authorized domains
3. WHEN WebSocket messages are transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt the data in transit using TLS
4. IF an unauthorized origin attempts to connect THEN the system SHALL reject the connection and log the attempt
5. WHEN the WebSocket server is deployed THEN the system SHALL use valid SSL/TLS certificates

### Requirement 5: Optimized Data Fetching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load data efficiently, so that I experience fast page loads and minimal network overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AIEnhancedDashboard mounts THEN the system SHALL coordinate API calls to avoid redundant requests for the same data
2. WHEN multiple components need the same data THEN the system SHALL implement a caching strategy to reuse fetched data
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL implement request deduplication to prevent multiple simultaneous requests for the same resource
4. WHEN the user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL preserve cached data where appropriate to avoid refetching
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL cache them with appropriate TTL (time-to-live) values

### Requirement 6: Database Seeding Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database seeding process to complete successfully, so that I can populate the database with initial stock data without timeouts or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the seed-stocks function is executed THEN the system SHALL insert stock records in batches of 50-100 records at a time
2. WHEN a batch insert fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with the next batch
3. WHEN the seeding process completes THEN the system SHALL return a summary of successful and failed insertions
4. WHEN the function approaches the execution time limit THEN the system SHALL gracefully stop and report progress
5. IF the seeding process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL support resuming from the last successful batch

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive logging throughout the application, so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL log the request method, path, and response status
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with severity level, timestamp, and contextual information
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are established or closed THEN the system SHALL log connection events with client identifiers
4. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log slow queries and API calls that exceed threshold times
5. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints that report system status

### Requirement 8: API Rate Limiting and Throttling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API rate limiting implemented, so that the system is protected from abuse and excessive usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes API requests THEN the system SHALL track request counts per client IP or API key
2. WHEN a client exceeds the rate limit THEN the system SHALL return a 429 Too Many Requests status code
3. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the system SHALL include rate limit headers in responses (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining)
4. WHEN a client is rate limited THEN the system SHALL provide a Retry-After header indicating when they can retry
5. WHEN configuring rate limits THEN the system SHALL allow different limits for authenticated vs anonymous users

### Requirement 9: Connection Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle network interruptions gracefully, so that I can continue using the application when connectivity is restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff
2. WHEN reconnection succeeds THEN the system SHALL resubscribe to previously active stock symbols
3. WHEN the backend API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached data with a warning indicator
4. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL refresh stale data automatically
5. WHEN connection issues persist THEN the system SHALL provide a manual refresh option to the user

### Requirement 10: Production Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper configuration management for different environments, so that the application can be deployed securely across development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN sensitive configuration values are needed THEN the system SHALL never hardcode API keys, passwords, or secrets in source code
3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configuration files
4. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages indicating which values are required
5. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL disable debug logging and enable production optimizations
