# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the Stock Tracker application to production with full real-time capabilities. The deployment must include the frontend (Vercel), backend API (.NET), WebSocket server (Node.js), and Redis for pub/sub messaging, ensuring all features work seamlessly in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Deployment on Vercel

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the stock tracker application via a public URL, so that I can use it from anywhere without running local servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is deployed to Vercel THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public HTTPS URL
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully without errors
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL be properly injected at build time
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display the homepage within 3 seconds
5. IF the backend services are unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL gracefully fall back to simulated data

### Requirement 2: Backend API Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the .NET backend API deployed to a cloud platform, so that the frontend can fetch real market data and manage user operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the .NET API is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public HTTPS endpoint
2. WHEN the API receives requests THEN it SHALL respond within 2 seconds for stock quotes
3. WHEN the API connects to external data sources THEN it SHALL use the configured API keys
4. WHEN the API encounters errors THEN it SHALL return proper HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN the API starts THEN it SHALL connect to Redis successfully
6. IF Redis is unavailable THEN the API SHALL continue to function with degraded caching

### Requirement 3: WebSocket Server Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive real-time stock price updates, so that I can make timely investment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket server is deployed THEN it SHALL accept connections from the frontend
2. WHEN a client subscribes to a stock symbol THEN it SHALL receive price updates within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the WebSocket server receives updates from Redis THEN it SHALL broadcast them to subscribed clients
4. WHEN a client disconnects THEN the server SHALL clean up subscriptions properly
5. WHEN the server restarts THEN clients SHALL automatically reconnect
6. IF the backend API is unavailable THEN the WebSocket server SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 4: Redis Deployment and Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Redis deployed as a managed service, so that the pub/sub messaging system works reliably without manual maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible from both the backend API and WebSocket server
2. WHEN messages are published to Redis channels THEN they SHALL be delivered to all subscribers within 100ms
3. WHEN the Redis connection is lost THEN services SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. WHEN Redis is under load THEN it SHALL maintain sub-50ms latency for pub/sub operations
5. IF Redis reaches memory limits THEN it SHALL evict old cache entries using LRU policy

### Requirement 5: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment variables managed securely across all services, so that API keys and configuration are not exposed in code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN environment variables SHALL be configured in the hosting platform
2. WHEN API keys are needed THEN they SHALL be retrieved from environment variables only
3. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use environment-configured URLs
4. IF an environment variable is missing THEN the service SHALL log a clear error message
5. WHEN in production mode THEN debug logging SHALL be disabled

### Requirement 6: Service Integration and Communication

**User Story:** As a user, I want all services to work together seamlessly, so that I experience a fully functional application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL connect to the backend API using the configured URL
2. WHEN the frontend establishes a WebSocket connection THEN it SHALL use the configured WebSocket URL
3. WHEN the backend API receives stock data THEN it SHALL publish updates to Redis
4. WHEN the WebSocket server receives Redis messages THEN it SHALL broadcast to connected clients
5. WHEN any service fails THEN other services SHALL continue operating with degraded functionality

### Requirement 7: CORS and Security Configuration

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want proper CORS and security headers configured, so that the application is protected from common web vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend API receives requests THEN it SHALL validate the origin against allowed domains
2. WHEN responses are sent THEN they SHALL include security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL validate the origin
4. IF a request comes from an unauthorized origin THEN it SHALL be rejected with a 403 status
5. WHEN in production THEN HTTPS SHALL be enforced for all connections

### Requirement 8: Health Checks and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want health check endpoints on all services, so that I can monitor system status and detect issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a health check endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return the service status within 1 second
2. WHEN a service is healthy THEN the health check SHALL return HTTP 200
3. WHEN a service dependency is unavailable THEN the health check SHALL indicate degraded status
4. WHEN monitoring tools query health endpoints THEN they SHALL receive consistent status information
5. IF a service is unhealthy THEN the health check SHALL return HTTP 503

### Requirement 9: Deployment Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive deployment documentation, so that I can deploy and maintain the application without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include step-by-step instructions for each service
2. WHEN environment variables are documented THEN they SHALL include descriptions and example values
3. WHEN troubleshooting guides are provided THEN they SHALL cover common deployment issues
4. WHEN architecture diagrams are included THEN they SHALL show service relationships clearly
5. IF deployment fails THEN the documentation SHALL provide rollback procedures

### Requirement 10: Cost Optimization

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want the deployment to be cost-effective, so that I can run the application within budget constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN they SHALL use free tiers where available
2. WHEN scaling is configured THEN it SHALL start with minimal resources
3. WHEN Redis is deployed THEN it SHALL use a managed service with a free tier
4. WHEN the backend API is idle THEN it SHALL scale down to reduce costs
5. IF costs exceed thresholds THEN alerts SHALL be configured to notify administrators
