# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will replace the current 30-second polling mechanism with a true real-time WebSocket-based data streaming system for stock market data. The system will provide instant price updates, reduce server load, improve user experience, and maintain backward compatibility with fallback to polling when WebSocket connections fail. This is a critical production-level enhancement that will transform the application from interval-based updates to event-driven real-time data delivery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: WebSocket Connection Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the application to automatically establish and maintain a WebSocket connection, so that I receive instant price updates without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL attempt to establish a WebSocket connection to the backend server
2. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL display a connection status indicator showing "Connected - Real-Time"
3. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to polling mode with a 30-second interval
4. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s, up to 60s)
5. WHEN the WebSocket reconnects successfully THEN the system SHALL resubscribe to all previously subscribed symbols
6. WHEN the user navigates away from the application THEN the system SHALL gracefully close the WebSocket connection
7. WHEN the connection is in polling fallback mode THEN the system SHALL display a status indicator showing "Connected - Polling"

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Price Updates

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see stock prices update instantly when they change, so that I can make timely trading decisions based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subscribed stock price changes on the backend THEN the frontend SHALL receive the update within 500ms
2. WHEN a price update is received THEN the UI SHALL update the displayed price immediately without page refresh
3. WHEN a price increases THEN the system SHALL highlight the price in green for 2 seconds
4. WHEN a price decreases THEN the system SHALL highlight the price in red for 2 seconds
5. WHEN multiple price updates arrive simultaneously THEN the system SHALL batch process them to avoid UI thrashing
6. WHEN a price update includes timestamp information THEN the system SHALL display "Last updated: X seconds ago"
7. IF a price update fails to parse THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other updates

### Requirement 3: Symbol Subscription Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to automatically subscribe to stocks I'm viewing and unsubscribe when I navigate away, so that I only receive relevant updates and minimize bandwidth usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a stock detail page THEN the system SHALL subscribe to that stock's real-time updates
2. WHEN a user navigates away from a stock detail page THEN the system SHALL unsubscribe from that stock after 5 seconds
3. WHEN a user adds a stock to their watchlist THEN the system SHALL subscribe to that stock's updates
4. WHEN a user removes a stock from their watchlist THEN the system SHALL unsubscribe from that stock
5. WHEN the dashboard loads with multiple stocks THEN the system SHALL subscribe to all visible stocks in a single batch request
6. WHEN a user has more than 50 active subscriptions THEN the system SHALL prioritize watchlist and portfolio stocks
7. IF a subscription request fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with 2-second intervals

### Requirement 4: Backend WebSocket Server Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the .NET backend to integrate with the WebSocket server, so that real-time data flows from external APIs through our backend to the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the .NET backend receives market data from external APIs THEN it SHALL push updates to the WebSocket server
2. WHEN the WebSocket server receives data from the .NET backend THEN it SHALL broadcast to all subscribed clients within 100ms
3. WHEN no clients are subscribed to a symbol THEN the backend SHALL stop fetching data for that symbol to conserve API quota
4. WHEN the WebSocket server starts THEN it SHALL register itself with the .NET backend
5. IF the WebSocket server becomes unavailable THEN the .NET backend SHALL queue updates for up to 5 minutes
6. WHEN the WebSocket server reconnects THEN the .NET backend SHALL flush queued updates
7. WHEN the system detects duplicate data THEN it SHALL deduplicate before broadcasting to clients

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the WebSocket system to handle multiple concurrent users efficiently, so that the application remains responsive under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 100 concurrent users are connected THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second update latency
2. WHEN broadcasting updates to multiple clients THEN the system SHALL use message batching to reduce overhead
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure by throttling updates
4. WHEN a client is slow to process messages THEN the system SHALL buffer up to 100 messages before disconnecting that client
5. WHEN the WebSocket server restarts THEN all clients SHALL automatically reconnect within 30 seconds
6. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN metrics SHALL be exposed via a /metrics endpoint
7. IF the system detects a memory leak THEN it SHALL log detailed diagnostics and alert administrators

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the application to handle connection errors gracefully, so that I continue to receive data even when network issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with context and attempt recovery
2. WHEN the network connection is lost THEN the system SHALL display a "Reconnecting..." message to the user
3. WHEN reconnection attempts fail 5 times THEN the system SHALL permanently fall back to polling mode
4. WHEN invalid data is received THEN the system SHALL reject it and request a fresh update
5. IF the backend API is unavailable THEN the WebSocket server SHALL return cached data with a staleness indicator
6. WHEN a client sends malformed messages THEN the server SHALL respond with a descriptive error message
7. WHEN the system recovers from an error THEN it SHALL notify the user with a "Connection restored" message

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Environment Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure WebSocket settings for different environments, so that I can test locally and deploy to production seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL connect to ws://localhost:8081
2. WHEN running in production mode THEN the system SHALL connect to the configured WSS URL with TLS
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and log warnings
4. WHEN the VITE_ENABLE_WEBSOCKET flag is false THEN the system SHALL use polling mode exclusively
5. IF the WebSocket URL is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully and fall back to polling
6. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the WebSocket server SHALL be deployed as a separate service
7. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL not require code changes, only environment variable updates

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging tools, so that I can troubleshoot WebSocket issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket events occur THEN the system SHALL log connection, subscription, and error events
2. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL display a debug panel showing connection status and message flow
3. WHEN a user reports issues THEN developers SHALL be able to enable verbose logging via a query parameter
4. WHEN monitoring production THEN the system SHALL track metrics: connection count, message rate, error rate, latency
5. IF message latency exceeds 1 second THEN the system SHALL log a warning with timing details
6. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL display all WebSocket messages in the browser console
7. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return connection statistics and system health

### Requirement 9: Data Consistency and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to ensure that the data I see is accurate and consistent, so that I can trust the information for making trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching from polling to WebSocket THEN the system SHALL ensure no data gaps occur during transition
2. WHEN receiving out-of-order messages THEN the system SHALL use timestamps to maintain correct sequence
3. WHEN a price update conflicts with cached data THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent timestamp
4. IF the WebSocket and polling data differ THEN the system SHALL log the discrepancy and use WebSocket data
5. WHEN the page regains focus after being backgrounded THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data to ensure accuracy
6. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN each SHALL maintain independent WebSocket connections
7. WHEN data staleness exceeds 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a warning indicator

### Requirement 10: User Experience Enhancements

**User Story:** As a trader, I want visual feedback about the real-time connection status, so that I know whether I'm seeing live data or delayed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket is connected THEN a green indicator SHALL display "Live" in the UI
2. WHEN using polling fallback THEN a yellow indicator SHALL display "Delayed (30s)"
3. WHEN disconnected THEN a red indicator SHALL display "Offline"
4. WHEN hovering over the status indicator THEN a tooltip SHALL show detailed connection information
5. WHEN a price update is received via WebSocket THEN a subtle pulse animation SHALL indicate the update
6. WHEN the connection status changes THEN a toast notification SHALL inform the user
7. WHEN viewing the settings page THEN users SHALL be able to toggle WebSocket on/off manually
