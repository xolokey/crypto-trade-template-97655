# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the branding assets across the web application by replacing the old favicon and logo with new "Lokey & Co Homestead" branded images. The application currently uses a Command icon as a placeholder logo and a generic favicon. The new branding includes multiple variations of the Lokey & Co logo (light, dark, shield-only, and full versions) that need to be integrated throughout the application for consistent brand identity.
