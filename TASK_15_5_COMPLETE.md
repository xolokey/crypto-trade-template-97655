**Verification Method**:
- Latency test can be combined with load test
- Tests under various network conditions

## Key Features

### Network Condition Simulation

Tests under 5 different network conditions:

| Condition | Delay | Jitter | Packet Loss | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Ideal** | 0ms | 0ms | 0% | Local development |
| **Good** | 20ms | ±5ms | 0% | Good broadband |
| **Moderate** | 50ms | ±15ms | 1% | Average connection |
| **Poor** | 100ms | ±30ms | 3% | Slow connection |
| **Bad** | 200ms | ±50ms | 5% | Very poor network |

### Comprehensive Metrics

The test measures and reports:
- **Message Statistics**: Sent, received, success rate, errors
- **Raw Latency**: WebSocket-only latency
- **Simulated Latency**: End-to-end with network conditions
- **Percentiles**: Min, Max, Average, Median, P95, P99
- **Distribution**: Visual latency distribution
- **Pass/Fail**: Automatic verification against 500ms threshold

### Automated Verification

- Automatically verifies P95 < 500ms
- Reports pass/fail for each network condition
- Provides overall test result
- Exit code 0 for pass, 1 for fail (CI/CD friendly)

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Redis
redis-server

# Terminal 2 - Start WebSocket Server
cd backend-ws
npm start

# Terminal 3 - Run Latency Test
cd backend-ws
npm run latency-test
```

### Available Commands

```bash
# Standard test (ideal, good, moderate, poor)
npm run latency-test

# Fast test (ideal only)
npm run latency-test:ideal

# Comprehensive test (all conditions)
npm run latency-test:all

# Custom conditions
TEST_CONDITIONS=ideal,good node latency-test.js
```

## Expected Results

### Performance Targets

| Network Condition | Expected P95 | Expected P99 | Status |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Ideal | < 100ms | < 150ms | ✅ PASS |
| Good | < 150ms | < 200ms | ✅ PASS |
| Moderate | < 250ms | < 350ms | ✅ PASS |
| Poor | < 400ms | < 500ms | ✅ PASS |
